# Kaggle Bike Share Competition
This repository contains the R script used for the Kaggle Bike Share competition. The goal of the competition was to predict the number of bike rentals in a given hour based on historical usage patterns.

This project aims to develop a predictive model for bike rentals using various features such as weather conditions, time of day, and other relevant factors. The model helps in understanding the demand for bike rentals and optimizing the bike-sharing system.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle and includes the following features:

**datetime:** Hourly date + timestamp

**season:** Season (1: winter, 2: spring, 3: summer, 4: fall)

**holiday:** Whether the day is a holiday or not

**workingday:** Whether the day is a working day or not

**weather:** Weather condition (1: clear, 2: mist, 3: light snow/rain, 4: heavy rain/snow)

**temp:** Temperature in Celsius

**atemp:** "Feels like" temperature in Celsius

**humidity:** Relative humidity

**windspeed:** Wind speed

**casual:** Number of non-registered user rentals initiated

**registered:** Number of registered user rentals initiated

**count:** Total number of bike rentals (target variable)


## Model
